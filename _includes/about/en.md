Hi, I am *@mengyun* (Mengyun, Wang), learning to become a computer software engineer or a self-driving car engineer. I'm going to study computer science in NorthEastern University in USA. 

I studied Transportation (Civil Aviation Management) from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](www.nuaa.edu.cn) by 2018, and will study Information Science at [Northeastern University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University) from 2018.
